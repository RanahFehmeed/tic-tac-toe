# This my tic-tac-toe game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and classic two-player game where the objective is to be the first to create a line of three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns selecting empty squares, trying to place their symbol in a position that completes a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The game is won when a player aligns three of their symbols in a row. If all nine squares are filled and no player has achieved this, the game ends in a draw.

This implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe allows for a straightforward, enjoyable experience that can be played between two users. It's an excellent way to pass time while testing your strategic thinking and foresight. The game includes features like:

Turn-based Play: Players alternate turns, making their moves strategically.
Win Detection: Automatically detects and announces the winner or a draw.
Reset Functionality: Easily reset the game to play again without refreshing the page.
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned player, this version of Tic-Tac-Toe offers a fun and challenging experience!
